# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Cord! Community contributions are essential to keep the project healthy and sustainable.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. Keep in mind that all contributions are done on a voluntary basis, including those of the projectâ€™s maintainers.

## Contributions we are looking for

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or directly by writing code which can be incorporated into the Cord project. Feel free to look at the list of [open issues](https://github.com/getcord/cord-preview/issues) and pick something that interests you that is not already assigned to someone.

## Things we are not looking for

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Vgt5c26VwG) where you can ask questions and get help. If your problem is not strictly Cord-specific, Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

## Contribution Guidelines

This project is used by multiple companies and teams, so we have a few guidelines to follow when contributing.

* All contributions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
* Ensure cross-browser compatibility for every change that's accepted. We try our best to support evergreen browsers such as Chromium based browsers, Firefox, and Safari.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep pull requests as small as possible to make it easier for us to review and merge.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Getting started

Instructions for getting the project running locally, refer to the README. When you're ready to make your changes, follow these steps:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, submit a pull request

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Contact one of the project maintainers directly via the Discord server.

When filing an issue, make sure you completely fill out the issue template. The more information you provide, the more likely someone will be able to help you. If you can provide a reproduction of the bug, it will be much easier to diagnose the problem.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Feel free to create an issue with the `enhancement` label and fill it out with as much detail as possible. There is no guarantee that a feature request will be accepted, but we will try to respond to it as quickly as possible. Always remember that the maintainers of this project are volunteers and are not paid to work on this project.

## Code review process

The core team will try to review Pull Requests as soon as they're able. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Vgt5c26VwG) to chat with the core team and other contributors as well as the rest of the community. It's a great place to ask questions, get help, and share your ideas.
